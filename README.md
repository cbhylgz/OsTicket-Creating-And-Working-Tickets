<h1>osTicket: Creating and Working Tickets</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this final section of the osTicket guide, I will show you a day in the life of a ticket, from its opening, to its closing. I will also show off how an admin can do things such as assign tickets to specific agents or teams, tweak the SLAs (Service Level Agreement), and how leaving comments can help with smooth communication between users and admins.
<br/>
<br/>

This is a continuation of the [osTicket: Post Installation Configuration](https://github.com/cbhylgz/OsTicket-Configuration) project.

- <b>osTicket</b>

<h2>Steps to Take:</h2>

<p align="center">
First off, go to the end user site of osTicket (http://localhost/osTicket); we will need to do so to make new tickets: <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Open three new tickets and fill out the users' information along with the technical issues in the text box: <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Now, log in as one of the agents we made in the last part: <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
From here, you can see every single ticket we've made: <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
By clicking on one, you can check its information in more detail: <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You can also change the priority and leave a note underneath: <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Assign a ticket by clicking on "Unassigned" next to the "Assigned To" section and choose an agent to assign the ticket to: <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Changing the tickets' SLA is also possible by going to the "SLA Plan" section: <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
You can also change the tickets' department in the Department section. All of these changes can be seen in the open tickets section: <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The ticket thread right here will show you all of the changes the ticket went through, including comments: <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
To resolve a ticket, go to the Ticket Status dropdown menu at the bottom and select "Resolved": <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Once resolved, it will no longer be a part of the open tickets tab and instead be in the closed tickets tab: <br/>
